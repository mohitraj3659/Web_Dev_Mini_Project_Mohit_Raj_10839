🧮 BMI Calculator Website
📌 Project Overview

This project is a simple and user-friendly BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to enter their height and weight, calculate their BMI, and instantly view their BMI category such as Underweight, Normal, Overweight, or Obese. The design is minimal with subtle colors to ensure a calm and distraction-free user experience.

🎯 Why This Project Matters

Body Mass Index is a commonly used health indicator that helps people understand whether their body weight is within a healthy range. Many people are unaware of how BMI is calculated or what their result means. This project makes the calculation simple and accessible through a web interface. It also shows how basic web technologies can be used to create practical, real-life applications.

🛠️ Technologies Used

HTML – for structure

CSS – for styling and layout

JavaScript – for logic and BMI calculation

📘 What I Learned

How to connect HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a single project

Handling user input and validating data properly

Performing calculations dynamically using JavaScript

Updating content on the webpage without refreshing

Designing a clean and responsive layout with minimal effects

⚠️ Difficulties Faced

Understanding the correct BMI formula and applying it accurately

Validating user input to avoid incorrect or empty values

Making the design simple but still visually appealing

Displaying results dynamically in a clear and readable way
